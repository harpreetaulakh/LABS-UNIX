What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication?

There are a few differences between synchronous and asynchronous communication. 
The main difference is that synchronous communications happen in the moment, meaning that it’s faster and more dynamic. 
This means that it’s also good for participation and active discussions with smaller groups.
Conversely, asynchronous communication happens over a period of time, so there’s no need to schedule anything. 
You can go at your own pace, without as many disruptions. 


Do you prefer socket reads in a receive thread or do you prefer both socket read and write to be in the main() function? Why?

Sockets are not thread safe, because operations included in sockets are not atomic, which means socket read and write operations are independant. And if socket reads
are done in threads, there will be close() functions as well in those threads which creates the possibility of attempting to run close() operation multiple times, 
which may cause complications related to file descriptor errors.
